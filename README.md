## StemDownloader - A basic app to download Donda 2 songs.

### Usage
Just open in your desired C# IDE and compile. Alternatively, download and run the pre-compiled release.

To listen to any of the songs, navigate to your music directory. This is a very basic app and I will consider making it more modular/customisable in terms of where the songs save and what audio codecs are used. If you have enough knowledge, you can change these yourself in the source code.
